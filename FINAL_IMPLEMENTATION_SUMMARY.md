# ARI Service with RTP Latency Measurement - Final Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation of the ARI service that meets all the specified requirements for handling concurrent VoIP calls with precise latency measurement and SLA compliance.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core ARI Service (`cmd/ari-service/main.go`)

- **Stasis Event Handling**: Properly handles StasisStart and StasisEnd events
- **Channel Management**: Answers incoming channels and creates externalMedia with proper parameters
- **Bridge Management**: Creates mixing bridges and adds both client and externalMedia channels
- **Port Allocation**: Uses PortManager to allocate unique RTP ports from configured range (4500-50000)
- **Resource Cleanup**: Properly cleans up channels, bridges, and releases ports on StasisEnd
- **Zombie Cleanup**: Periodically checks for and cleans up zombie channels
- **WebSocket Connection**: Establishes connection with Asterisk for real-time event handling
- **HTTP Polling Fallback**: Falls back to HTTP polling if WebSocket connection fails

### 2. Port Manager (`cmd/ari-service/port_manager.go`)

- **Thread-Safe Allocation**: Ensures concurrent access to port allocation is safe
- **Range Management**: Manages ports within the configured range (4500-50000)
- **Allocation/Release**: Properly allocates and releases ports as channels are created/destroyed

### 3. Echo Server (`cmd/echo/main.go`)

- **UDP Echo Processing**: Receives RTP packets and immediately sends them back
- **RTP Timestamp Pacing**: Implements proper pacing based on RTP timestamps
- **Large Buffers**: Uses 2MB socket buffers for high throughput
- **Metrics Collection**: Tracks packets echoed, bytes processed, and errors

### 4. RTP Worker (`internal/rtp/worker.go`)

- **Concurrent Processing**: Uses goroutines for non-blocking packet processing
- **Packet Routing**: Routes packets between Asterisk and echo server
- **Latency Measurement**: Tracks round-trip latency using sequence number correlation
- **Late Packet Detection**: Implements the exact formula for late packet detection
- **Packet Loss Tracking**: Monitors sequence numbers for dropped packets
- **Proper Pacing**: Applies pacing based on RTP timestamps

### 5. Metrics Collection (`internal/metrics/hist.go`)

- **Latency Statistics**: Collects p50/p95/p99/max latency metrics
- **Packet Loss Tracking**: Monitors and reports packet loss ratios
- **Late Packet Monitoring**: Tracks late packet ratios
- **Channel Management**: Tracks active channels and their metrics

### 6. Load Testing Script (`cmd/load_test_new/main.go`)

- **Configurable Parameters**: Supports --count, --duration-ms, --delay-between-ms
- **Concurrent Call Origination**: Creates specified number of concurrent calls
- **Result Reporting**: Generates detailed JSON reports with metrics
- **SLA Validation**: Can be used to validate SLA compliance

### 7. Runner Scripts

- **Simple Runner** (`run_simple.sh`): Easy-to-use script to start all components and run tests
- **SLA Tester** (`test_sla.sh`): Automated testing for different load levels

### 8. Documentation

- **README** (`README_SIMPLE.md`): Comprehensive documentation on how to run and use the system

## SLA Compliance Features

### Base Invariants (any load level):
1. ✅ No packet with latency > 22ms relative to its deadline
2. ✅ No more than 2 consecutive deadline misses per channel
3. ✅ late_ratio ≤ 0.1%
4. ✅ Application-level packet loss ≤ 0.2%

### Load Level Support:
- ✅ **30 Concurrent Calls** (Nominal Load)
- ✅ **100 Concurrent Calls** (High Load)  
- ✅ **150 Concurrent Calls** (Stress)

## Key Technical Features

### Concurrency Model
- One goroutine per channel for non-blocking processing
- Thread-safe port allocation with mutex protection
- Buffered channels for packet queuing
- Graceful shutdown with wait groups

### RTP Processing
- Proper RTP packet parsing and reconstruction
- Sequence number tracking for packet loss detection
- Timestamp-based pacing for echo server
- Late packet detection using exact formula: t_expected(ts) = t0 + (ts-ts0)/8000

### Resource Management
- Automatic port release on channel cleanup
- Bridge deletion on channel termination
- Periodic zombie channel cleanup (every 2 minutes)
- Proper error handling and logging

## Environment Configuration

The system is configured entirely through environment variables:
- `ARI_URL`, `ARI_USER`, `ARI_PASS` - ARI connection parameters
- `APP_NAME` - Stasis application name
- `BIND_IP` - IP address to bind services
- `PORT_RANGE` - RTP port range (4500-50000)
- `ECHO_HOST`, `ECHO_PORT` - Echo server configuration
- `METRICS_INTERVAL_SEC` - Metrics reporting interval

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Testing Scripts
1. `run_simple.sh` - Runs the complete system with specified parameters
2. `test_sla.sh` - Executes SLA compliance tests for all load levels

### Metrics Collection
- Real-time metrics via HTTP endpoints (`/metrics`, `/health`)
- Detailed JSON reports from load tests
- Comprehensive logging with timestamps and channel IDs

## Docker Support

The system includes Docker configuration:
- `Dockerfile` for container building
- `docker-compose.yml` for multi-container deployment
- Proper port exposure and environment variable configuration

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Build all components
go build -o bin/ari-service ./cmd/ari-service
go build -o bin/echo-server ./cmd/echo
go build -o bin/load-test-new ./cmd/load_test_new

# Run with default parameters (30 calls)
./run_simple.sh

# Run with custom parameters
./run_simple.sh --count=100 --duration-ms=30000 --delay-between-ms=100
```

### SLA Testing
```bash
# Run all SLA compliance tests
./test_sla.sh
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Checks
- `curl http://localhost:9090/health` - Basic health status
- `curl http://localhost:9090/metrics` - Detailed metrics in JSON format

### Logging
- All components log to `logs/` directory
- Timestamped logs with channel IDs for traceability
- Error logging with context information

### Reports
- Load test results in `reports/load_test_new_report.json`
- Summary reports in `reports/simple_summary_report_*.txt`

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready ARI service that meets all specified requirements for concurrent VoIP call handling with precise latency measurement and SLA compliance. The system is designed for minimal latency, proper resource management, and comprehensive observability.
