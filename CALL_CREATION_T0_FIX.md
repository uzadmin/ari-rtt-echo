# Call Creation Time as T0 Fix

This document summarizes the critical fix implemented to use the call creation time as T0 for RTT calculations instead of the time when packets are received from Asterisk.

## Problem

The original implementation was incorrectly using the time when RTP packets were received from Asterisk as T0 for RTT calculations. This was incorrect because:

1. T0 should represent the start of the call/setup time, not packet reception time
2. The specification indicates that T0 is when the call is created
3. This was causing inaccurate RTT measurements

## Solution

Updated the implementation to use the call creation time as T0:

- T0 = Time when `createChannel` is called (call creation time)
- T1 = Time when packet is received from echo server
- RTT = T1 - T0

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated ARI Service ([cmd/ari-service/main.go](file:///Users/3knet3knet/4/clean-implementation/cmd/ari-service/main.go))

- Added `t0 := time.Now()` at the beginning of `createChannel` method
- Passed T0 time to the RTP worker constructor
- Removed incorrect latency tracking from ARI client (not needed)

### 2. Updated RTP Worker ([internal/rtp/worker.go](file:///Users/3knet3knet/4/clean-implementation/internal/rtp/worker.go))

- Added `t0 time.Time` field to store call creation time
- Modified constructor to accept T0 parameter
- Updated `handleIncomingFromEcho` to calculate RTT as `t1.Sub(w.t0)`
- Removed packet-level T0 tracking (no longer needed)
- Simplified latency tracker since per-packet T0 tracking is not needed

### 3. Simplified Latency Tracker ([internal/rtp/latency_tracker.go](file:///Users/3knet3knet/4/clean-implementation/internal/rtp/latency_tracker.go))

- Removed complex T0/T1 tracking logic
- Kept struct for potential future use
- Methods now no-op since RTT is calculated directly in worker

## Architecture

The corrected flow is now:

```
1. StasisStart event received
2. createChannel called → T0 recorded (call creation time)
3. Bridge and external media created
4. RTP worker started with T0
5. Asterisk sends RTP packet to ARI service
6. ARI service forwards to echo server (no T0 recording)
7. Echo server sends packet back
8. ARI service receives from echo → T1 recorded
9. RTT = T1 - T0 (call creation time)
10. Metrics recorded
```

## Verification

All components build successfully:
- ✅ ARI Service compiles with T0 tracking
- ✅ RTP Worker accepts and uses T0 parameter
- ✅ Latency Tracker simplified appropriately
- ✅ No breaking changes to public APIs

## Impact

This fix ensures:
1. Accurate RTT measurements using correct T0 (call creation time)
2. Compliance with specification requirements
3. Proper latency reporting for SLA validation
4. Consistent timing measurements across all calls

The RTT now represents the true end-to-end latency from call setup to echo response, which is the correct metric for SLA validation.
