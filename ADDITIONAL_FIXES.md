# Additional Fixes Implemented

This document summarizes the additional fixes implemented to address the issues identified in the ARI service implementation.

## 1. Fixed Echo Server Port

### Problem
The echo server was using port 8080 instead of the specified port 4000.

### Solution
Updated the echo server to use port 4000 as specified in the requirements.

### Changes Made
- Added `const EchoPort = 4000` in [cmd/echo/main.go](file:///Users/3knet3knet/4/clean-implementation/cmd/echo/main.go)
- Updated default configuration to use port 4000
- Updated [.env.example](file:///Users/3knet3knet/4/clean-implementation/.env.example) to reflect the correct port

## 2. Implemented RTP Timestamp Pacing

### Problem
Packets were being sent "as they arrived" without proper timing, which could cause packet bursts and violate SLA requirements.

### Solution
Implemented proper RTP timestamp-based pacing to ensure packets are sent at the correct intervals.

### Changes Made
- Added `PacketPacer` struct in [cmd/echo/main.go](file:///Users/3knet3knet/4/clean-implementation/cmd/echo/main.go)
- Implemented `CalculateDelay()` method to compute timing based on RTP timestamps
- Added `processEchoWithPacing()` method to apply proper delays
- For 8kHz sample rate: each timestamp unit = 1/8000 seconds = 125 microseconds

## 3. Increased Socket Buffer Size

### Problem
Socket buffers were using default sizes instead of the required 2MB, which could cause buffer overflow under high load.

### Solution
Set socket read and write buffers to 2MB each.

### Changes Made
- Updated [cmd/echo/main.go](file:///Users/3knet3knet/4/clean-implementation/cmd/echo/main.go) to set:
  - `s.conn.SetReadBuffer(2 * 1024 * 1024)` // 2MB
  - `s.conn.SetWriteBuffer(2 * 1024 * 1024)` // 2MB

## 4. Changed Load Tester to Use Command-Line Flags

### Problem
Load tester was using environment variables instead of command-line flags as specified in the requirements.

### Solution
Rewrote the load tester to use the `flag` package for configuration.

### Changes Made
- Replaced environment variable parsing with `flag` package in [cmd/load_test/main.go](file:///Users/3knet3knet/4/clean-implementation/cmd/load_test/main.go)
- Added flags:
  - `--ari-url` (default: localhost:8088)
  - `--ari-user` (default: ari)
  - `--ari-pass` (default: ari)
  - `--app-name` (default: ari-app)
  - `--endpoint` (default: Local/echo@ari-context)
  - `--concurrent` (default: 10)
  - `--duration` (default: 60)
  - `--call-duration` (default: 30)
  - `--report-file` (default: reports/load_test_report.json)
- Removed unused imports (`os/signal`, `syscall`)

## Verification

All fixes have been verified to compile successfully:
- ✅ Echo Server builds without errors and uses port 4000
- ✅ Load Test builds without errors and uses command-line flags
- ✅ Socket buffers are set to 2MB
- ✅ RTP timestamp pacing is implemented

## Impact

These fixes ensure that the system now:
1. Uses the correct port as specified (4000)
2. Properly paces RTP packets based on timestamps to prevent bursts
3. Has adequate socket buffer sizes to handle high load
4. Follows the specification for command-line flag usage in the load tester
