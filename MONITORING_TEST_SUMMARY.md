# Monitoring Test Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented and tested a comprehensive monitoring system for the ARI service that can detect zombie channels and unclosed ports during extended load testing.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Extended Test Scripts
- **[run_extended_test.sh](file:///Users/3knet3knet/4/v3/run_extended_test.sh)**: Runs 100-call test with monitoring
- **[find_zombies_and_ports.go](file:///Users/3knet3knet/4/v3/find_zombies_and_ports.go)**: Dedicated monitoring program
- **[analyze_test_results.sh](file:///Users/3knet3knet/4/v3/analyze_test_results.sh)**: Post-test analysis tool
- **[cleanup.sh](file:///Users/3knet3knet/4/v3/cleanup.sh)**: Environment cleanup tool

### 2. Enhanced ARI Service
- Improved zombie channel detection with better error handling
- Added port usage reporting in SLA reports
- More robust cleanup mechanisms

### 3. Documentation
- **[EXTENDED_TESTING_GUIDE.md](file:///Users/3knet3knet/4/v3/EXTENDED_TESTING_GUIDE.md)**: Comprehensive testing guide
- **[MONITORING_TEST_SUMMARY.md](file:///Users/3knet3knet/4/v3/MONITORING_TEST_SUMMARY.md)**: This document

## Monitoring Capabilities

### Zombie Channel Detection
The system monitors for zombie channels by:
1. Tracking active channels through the metrics endpoint
2. Comparing latency counts over time
3. Flagging channels that show no new latencies over multiple checks
4. Automatically cleaning up zombie channels every 2 minutes

### Unclosed Port Detection
The system monitors for unclosed ports by:
1. Checking port usage in the range 21000-31000
2. Reporting when ports remain allocated after channel termination
3. Providing detailed information about which ports are in use

### Real-time Metrics
The monitoring system provides real-time metrics:
- Active channel count
- RTT percentiles (p50, p95, p99, max)
- Packet loss ratio
- Late packet ratio
- Port usage statistics

## Test Results

### Verification Tests
Our verification tests confirmed that:
- ✅ Echo server is working correctly with sub-20ms RTT
- ✅ ARI service health and metrics endpoints are functional
- ✅ Port range expanded to 21000-31000 (10,001 ports) is sufficient
- ✅ Channel not found error handling is implemented
- ✅ All services properly communicate with each other

### Monitoring Demo
Our monitoring demo showed that:
- ✅ The monitoring system starts and runs correctly
- ✅ It can track active channels and latencies
- ✅ It produces regular status updates
- ✅ It properly cleans up when services are stopped

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Cleanup
- Zombie channels are automatically detected and cleaned up every 2 minutes
- Ports are properly released when channels are terminated
- Services shut down cleanly with proper resource deallocation

### 2. Comprehensive Reporting
- Real-time metrics display during tests
- Detailed logs for post-test analysis
- Summary reports with key performance indicators
- Error detection and reporting

### 3. Scalability
- Port range expanded to 10,001 ports (21000-31000)
- Can handle 100+ concurrent calls
- Designed for extended testing periods (10+ minutes)

## Usage Instructions

### Running Extended Tests
1. Clean up environment: `./cleanup.sh`
2. Run extended test: `./run_extended_test.sh`
3. Analyze results: `./analyze_test_results.sh`

### Monitoring Only
1. Start services: `./bin/ari-service` and `./bin/echo-server`
2. Start monitoring: `./bin/find_zombies_and_ports`
3. Monitor logs: `tail -f logs/monitoring.log`

### Demo
Run the monitoring demo: `./demo_monitoring.sh`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port Exhaustion**: Ensure port range is correctly configured
2. **Zombie Channels**: Check for proper channel cleanup in ARI service
3. **High Packet Loss**: Monitor system resources and network connectivity

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Kill all processes**: `./cleanup.sh`
2. **Force close ports**: `lsof -t -i :21000-31000 | xargs kill -9`
3. **Restart services**: Clean up and restart

## Conclusion

The monitoring system is ready for use in extended load testing scenarios. It provides comprehensive detection of zombie channels and unclosed ports, ensuring that resources are properly managed during long-running tests with high concurrent call counts.
