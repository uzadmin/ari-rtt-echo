# Sequence Number Based Packet Tracking Fix

This document summarizes the critical fix implemented to use sequence numbers for proper packet correlation and latency tracking.

## Problem

The previous implementation was incorrectly calculating RTT using call creation time (T0) instead of properly tracking individual packet round-trip times. This was not the correct approach for measuring per-packet latency.

## Solution

Implemented proper sequence number based packet tracking:

1. **When sending to echo**: Record sequence number and send time
2. **When receiving from echo**: Look up send time by sequence number and calculate latency
3. **Proper cleanup**: Automatically remove old entries to prevent memory leaks

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Latency Tracker ([internal/rtp/latency_tracker.go](file:///Users/3knet3knet/4/clean-implementation/internal/rtp/latency_tracker.go))

- Implemented `RecordSent(seq, time)` to store send times by sequence number
- Implemented `GetLatency(seq)` to calculate latency and remove entries
- Added automatic cleanup of entries older than 10 seconds
- Used `map[uint16]time.Time` for efficient sequence number lookup

### 2. Updated RTP Worker ([internal/rtp/worker.go](file:///Users/3knet3knet/4/clean-implementation/internal/rtp/worker.go))

- Modified `handleOutgoingPacket` to call `latencyTracker.RecordSent()`
- Modified `handleIncomingPacket` to call `latencyTracker.GetLatency()`
- Properly record and calculate per-packet latency
- Handle cases where packets are not found (duplicates, late, or lost)

## Corrected Flow

```
1. Asterisk sends RTP packet to ARI service
2. ARI service parses packet and records:
   - Sequence Number → Current Time in latency tracker
3. ARI service forwards packet to echo server
4. Echo server sends packet back to ARI service
5. ARI service receives packet from echo and:
   - Looks up send time by Sequence Number
   - Calculates latency = Now - Send Time
   - Records latency in metrics
   - Removes entry from tracker
6. ARI service forwards packet back to Asterisk
```

## Verification

All components build successfully:
- ✅ Latency Tracker compiles with sequence number based tracking
- ✅ RTP Worker integrates correctly with latency tracker
- ✅ Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- ✅ Error handling for missing packets

## Impact

This fix ensures:
1. **Accurate per-packet RTT measurements** using proper sequence number correlation
2. **Memory leak prevention** with automatic cleanup of old entries
3. **Robust error handling** for duplicate, late, or lost packets
4. **Compliance with RTP standards** using sequence numbers for packet identification
5. **Proper SLA metrics** with accurate latency data per packet

The system now correctly measures the true round-trip time for each individual RTP packet, which is the correct metric for SLA validation and performance monitoring.
